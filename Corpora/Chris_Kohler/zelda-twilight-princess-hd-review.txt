<em>Twilight

There was a time when HD graphics were enough of a novelty to impress on their own. I remember hooking up my launch-day Xbox 360 to my new thousand-dollar 26-inch flatscreen TV, loading up the videogame of Peter Jackson's <em>King Kong</em> and literally spending a minute staring at a rock.
To be fair, the rock looked like it had just been rained on, and so it had this shiny reflective surface that &#8230; OK, you probably had to be there. No one will ever see that rock the way I did during that fleeting moment, that particular technological inflection point. But while we were shelling out four figures to revel in millions more pixels than ever before, in came Nintendo to say it would stick with standard definition for a while, thanks. And topping the Wii's launch slate, leading the charge for inexpensive gaming, the standard-bearer of Good Enough, was <em>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</em>.
Now, nearly 10 years later, you'll be able to buy an HD version of <em>Twilight Princess</em> on March 4 for the Wii U. While it's not a tenth as exciting as an all-new <em>Zelda</em> (long in the works and expected before the year is through), maybe this extended <em>Zelda</em> refractory period is a good time to play through its 50-plus hours again? There are also a few gameplay tweaks, which may or may not be enough to change the experience in some fundamental ways.
<em>Twilight Princess</em> was, Nintendo would overtly admit later, created in response to American fans' disappointment with the cartoony style of its predecessor, <em>The Wind Waker</em>. In retrospect, it seems like Nintendo was trying (very hard) to prove it could do a dark, brooding <em>Zelda,</em> daring players to say the final product wasn't what they'd asked for. The game's plot involves shadow creatures casting a pall over the happy land of Hyrule. How much blacker can you get than a shadow? None more black.
Just seeing this old world with new high-definition textures and a visual overhaul brings back a bit of that staring-at-a-rock feeling from the first days of HD gaming. That's not because <em>Twilight Princess</em>&#8216;s graphics are particularly special, but because it's a reminder of the fact that we're still waiting for an original HD <em>Zelda</em>. Running around the world -- and you can tell that this is an old world, chopped into pieces so it can run on 2001 hardware and fit into 1.5 GB -- you can get a little sense of what it's going to be like to play a <em>Zelda</em> adventure that's HD from the ground up.
Gameplaywise, there's a little downgrade and a little upgrade. I really enjoyed using the Wii Remote's motion controls on the original <em>Twilight Princess</em> -- I can take or leave swinging the remote to slash my sword, but the point-and-shoot aiming coupled with the comfort level of the two-part controller was beautiful. (I went into a little more depth on this when I talked about Pikmin 3</em>.)
The Wii U version of the game ditches the motion controls, sadly. In their place, you can play with the GamePad, which uses the second screen to good effect. Link's arsenal of helpful items, which becomes quite the array of swappable gewgaws by game's end, can be displayed permanently on the second screen, and you can simply drag the item you want into place when you need it. Even at the game's outset, when you only have a few things kicking around in your magic bag of holding, this is helpful. You can also view your map on the second screen.
So, to my tastes anyway, there exists no clearly superior version of <em>Twilight Princess</em> from a controls perspective. Playing through a few hours of the Wii U version, I did find that Nintendo had made some welcome tweaks to the game's flow. As part of the game's dusky makeover, Link sometimes transforms into a wolf. But weirdly, and annoyingly, instead of going off like Bran Stark into the forests of Hyrule and chowing down on deer, wolf-Link faces situations that are far less cool: He has to poke around a clearing or village or somewhere, collecting Tears of Light squirreled away in pots and fireplaces, until he fills up a beaded necklace, at which time he reverts back to angsty teen.
These sections were boring, and they still are, but Nintendo has cut out a fairly large chunk of the Tears, meaning you don't have to hunt down as many in order to get it over with. Turning into wolf-Link still weirdly feels like a punishment, but not as much of one.
Speaking of wolf-Link, each copy of the game includes a Wolf Link Amiibo figurine, because of course it does. Using it opens up a new dungeon that you explore as a wolf, although I wasn't too thrilled with what I saw of it -- it was just a basic series of fights against increasingly tougher enemies drawn from the main game. I imagine that as you progress, it'll just open up more such fights.
Oh, and of course, Nintendo promises that the Wolf Link Amiibo will also be compatible with&#8230; the new Wii U <em>Legend of Zelda</em>. Which is what we're all really waiting for. It's difficult to take <em>Twilight Princess HD</em> on its own when its very existence seems to be born from the long gap between original games in the storied series (or on Wii U, period). Everybody -- Nintendo, players -- knows that this is a stopgap in a barren release schedule, but if you're going to have a stopgap, you might as well give an excellent game the graphical overhaul it lost when Nintendo decided to skip over high-definition.
