Cantina Talk: We'll Get More Rey on the <em>Force

Before we dive into the latest round of Star Wars news and rumors, drop everything, go to the kitchen to make yourself Rey's weird green inflating bread, because apparently that's a thing you can actually do. Isn't science wonderful? We haven't yet tried this—and therefore make no claims as to how tasty it may or may not be—but it is the perfect accompaniment to these transmissions intercepted from a Death Star somewhere in the Corellian system.

<strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> Highly probable, although these things are always open to last minute changes.<b
<strong>The Real Deal:</strong> While the release date for the DVD/Blu-ray of <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> remains a mystery (short version: seven (or maybe eight) deleted scenes available as extras. Editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon said that while Disney "has mentioned to us &#8230; that we should stop talking about them," the scenes include "one with Harrison Ford [and] one with Rey," but they're not giving away anything more. We're hoping for an extended version of Rey's vision in the temple that might, you know, reveal what was actually going on there.

<strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> While officially non-canon (blame the Lego connection), this might be the closest we'll get to a <em>Force Awakens</em> prequel anytime soon. As a plus, it's awesome.<b
<strong>The Real Deal:</strong> Hey, want to watch a cartoon showing Lego versions of Poe Dameron, Captain Phasma, Kylo Ren, and BB-8 in action prior to <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>? Sure you do.

"Poe to the Rescue" is the first episode of <em>The Resistance Rises</em>, a series of animated shorts airing on Disney XD (and online) using characters and situations from the most recent Star Wars movie. Between this and Marvel's <em>Poe Dameron</em> comic book launching in April, it certainly seems as if fans of Oscar Isaac's <em>Force Awakens</em> character will have a lot to entertain them until <em>Episode VIII </em>lands in 2017. But what about fans of the <em>other</em> new characters?

<strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> Given the source, take this as canon. Literally.<b
<strong>The Real Deal:</strong> Perhaps you've not been following <em>Star Wars: Servants of the Empire</em>, Jason Fry's series of kids' books (maybe you didn't even know it exists), but they offer some juicy details. The final installment in the series, <em>The Secret Academy</em> reveals the secret origin of the First Order through the backstory of character Zare Leonis. It also reveals the early days of the plan to brainwash kids into becoming stormtroopers, and the man who started it all: the father of the movie's General Hux. It's all coming together and making a little bit more sense, now. (Although now we're wondering if the Rebellion/New Republic ever knew about this evil version of the Jedi Academy and tried to shut it down after <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.)

<strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> At this point, who can say? We'll know more in May. Probably.<b
<strong>The Real Deal:</strong> Cinelinx and, importantly, StarWars.com contributor Jordan Maison quietly dropped this on Twitter:

This coincides with a lot of the chatter about Gareth Edwards' prequel to the original movie (it's about the stealing of the Death Star plans that Darth Vader &amp; Co. are pursuing at the start of <em>A New Hope</em>), and it feels like an interesting direction. On the one hand, <em>Rogue One</em> must do something to prove there's more to the Star Wars universe than the major movies, but on the other, going too dark and losing the humor of the original series could be problematic for a lot of fans. Of course, it might be that it's the <em>trailers</em> that are dark? They're rumored to show up attached to <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> in May, so we'll see for ourselves then.

<strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> 100 percent confirmed (but also, concept art, so there's wiggle room).<b
<strong>The Real Deal:</strong> As revealed by Harrison Ford on ABC's <em>Wonderful World of Disney: Disneyland 60</em> TV special, artwork has been released for the planned Star Wars additions to Disneyland and Walt Disney World Resorts, and it kind of looks amazing. You'll get to pilot the <em>Millennium Falcon</em> and run for cover in the middle of a fight between the First Order and the Resistance! You can explore life-size X-wings! The 14-acre areas of each park look like the stuff of fan dreams. Construction is already underway, but no opening dates have been announced. It doesn't really matter, though, because no date would be soon enough.
