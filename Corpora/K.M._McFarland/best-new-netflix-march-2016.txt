Beware the overwhelming new additions to the Netflix library in March, dear readers! There are tons of new movies and shows coming to Netflix this month, from Captain America’s directorial debut (Chris Evans' <em>Before We Go</em>) to the only season of the US remake of <em>The Returned</em>, but we’ve highlighted 10 of our favorites below. The beginning of the month is full of classic films and the return of Netflix’s flagship original series, while after the ides sees new <em>Daredevil</em> and the return of a beloved comedy oddball in his first feature film in almost 30 years. (We know he is, but what are <em>you</em>?)

<strong><em>Adult Beginners</em> (2015)</strong><b
Nick Kroll stars as an entrepreneur whose company fails on the eve of its launch, and subsequently moves in with his sister (Rosey Byrne) and brother-in-law (Bobby Cannavale). Kroll is a serious comic talent who ended his sketch series <em>Kroll Show</em> on his own terms and has turned his sights on other projects. Think of this like one of Kristen Wiig’s recent projects—it's not a straightforward comedy, but succeeds thanks to the strength of a central performance.

<strong><em>Good Burger</em> (1997)</strong><b
Based on a sketch from Nickelodeon sketch series <em>All-That</em>, this cult classic starring Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell centers on the titular fast food restaurant competing with the corporate burger chain Mondo Burger across the street. We hate to say it, but if you’re a 90’s kid, throw on “We’re All Dudes” and take a nostalgia trip with this comedy, which touts supporting performances from Sinbad, Linda Cardellini, George Clinton, Shaq, and even the late, great Abe Vigoda.

<strong><em>Groundhog Day</em> (1993)</strong><b

<strong><em> Scarface</em> (1983)</strong><b
Brian De Palma’s remake of the classic 1932 gangster film trades 1920s Chicago for 1980s Miami. Al Pacino plays Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant who rises from the bottom to become a cocaine kingpin in one of the most violent, stylized, and oft-quoted crime films ever made.

<strong><em>Star Trek: The Motion Picture</em> (1979)/<em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em> (1982)</strong>
With the new series from showrunner Bryan Fuller on the horizon, now's a good time to catch up on the first films in the <em>Star Trek</em> franchise. The initial installment picks up 10 years after the original CBS series with the crew of the <em>USS Enterprise</em>, and <em>II </em>is widely considered the best of the entire series, featuring the return of Ricardo Montalbano as the titular KHAAAAAAAAAAN!

<strong><em>House of Cards</em>, season 4</strong><b
Netflix’s flagship original series enters its fourth season, as President Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) and First Lady Claire Underwood (Robin Wright) continue to struggle against each other while maintaining political authority on the campaign trail. The original British series, based on a series of novels, only ran for three series, so the Netflix version has already extended beyond the scope of the original, which means more bloody political intrigue to binge-watch whenever a 2016 election event isn’t already happening.

<strong><em>Cuckoo</em>, seasons 1-2</strong><b
A young British woman returns home to attend medical school after a gap year, but her parents don’t know she’s been married to an American hippie (Andy Samberg). Anyone who enjoyed Samberg on <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> will find something to love here. (A U.S. remake, starring Michael Chiklis, Cheryl Hines, and Flula Borg (<em>Pitch Perfect 2</em>) got a pilot at NBC, but never made it to series.)

<strong><em>Netflix Presents: The Characters</em>, season 1</strong>
The recent trend of sketch shows centers on one or two central performers who guide the vision of a series, like <em>Key &amp; Peele</em>, <em>Kroll Show</em>, or <em>Inside Amy Schemer</em>. <em>The Characters</em> instead hands the reins of each episode to a single comedian, including Lauren Lapkus (<em>Orange is the New Black</em>), Paul W. Downs (<em>Broad City</em>), and Henry Zebrowski (<em>A to Z</em>). Based on that novel format alone, it should be an intriguing new comedy series.

<strong><em>Daredevil</em>, season 2</strong><b
The first season of <em>Daredevil</em> kicked off the Netflix “street level” wing of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and featured one of the best single-take fight scenes in television history. This new season sees the addition of Frank Castle (Jon Bernthal), aka The Punisher, and Matt Murdock’s long-lost former flame, Elektra Natchios (Élodie Yung).

<strong><em>Pee-wee’s Big Holiday</em></strong><b
Comedian Paul Reubens’ most famous character, Pee-wee Herman, returned to the stage in 2010, but it was all building to a new original film. Produced by Judd Apatow and co-written by Reubens and Paul Rust (Netflix’s <em>Love</em>), <em>Pee-wee’s Big Holiday</em> is a road trip comedy that takes the character out of small town life in Fairville and sets him on an adventure after a chance meeting with a motorcycle-riding rebel (Joe Manganiello).
