The 2016 Oscars Actually Didn't Suck. Here's How to Make Them <em>Good

In the final moments of last night's Academy Awards telecast—just as the team behind <em>Spotlight</em> was ambling victoriously around the stage, and shortly after Public Enemy's "Fight the Power" had Perez-punched its way into the closing credits—a strange thought came to mind: <em>Wait, was that show weirdly not terrible? Was it maybe even</em>&#8230;<em>good</em>?
It was a given, of course, that host Chris Rock—whose opening monologue, about the decades-long history between blacks and Hollywood, was just as raw and flawed as it had to be—would serve as a superior host over recent one-and-doners like Neil Patrick Harris (too hokey) and Seth MacFarlane (too bro-key), and that the Lady Gaga turning over the stage to sexual assault survivors to Rock coining the term "sorority racist" to Russell Crowe being funny for the first time in, oh, his entire 51-year existence. 
And let's not forget that between the musical performances and banter, some pretty deserving filmmakers actually won, including the <em>Spotlight</em> crew (for Best Picture) and nearly everyone who worked behind-the-scenes on <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, each of whom hit the stage with a coolness and you-do-do aesthetic that made them look like the staff at an especially funky Australian charter school.
There were plenty of lowlights, too—let's hope we never again have to face the snoozy specter of Sam Smith's awful James Bond song, or the smug mug of Ali G—but for the most part, this year's awards felt like one of the year's most overlooked movies, <em>Straight Outta Compton</em>: zippy, essential, and justifiably cocky. In fact, for once, we're actually <em>excited</em> for next year's event—provided they follow some of these guidelines:
Granted, goofy puns. Speaking of which&#8230;
Remember when Chris Evans and Chadwick Boseman presented last night? No? Well, that's OK—they probably don't remember, either, and are instead spending the day chilling at Downey's superfood-vineyard in Malibu. But you no doubt recall Louis C.K. not-so-gently riffing on James Bond's sex life, or Steve Carrell pointing out that "Tina [Fey] has been drinking." The easiest way to get rid of all the stuffy banter that makes everyone (including the presenters) tune out is to ditch the well-intentioned actors and instead turn to our country's greatest natural resource—our dark-hearted, Oscar-ignored comedians. These are the people who regularly earn big laughs while grappling with difficult questions; surely, they can find a way to illuminate the differences between sound design and sound editing.
Though she may have lost last night in the Best Original Song category, Gaga's performance of "Til It Happens to You"—a deft merger of musical performance and political statement—was her second show-stealing Oscar appearance in a row: Last year, she woke up a slumbering ceremony (and the pop-culture commentariat) with space-egg management—and guarantee her the kind of global platform (and audience) that the music industry often struggles to provide nowadays.
The Oscar producers have always insisted on stuffing the broadcast with semi-pertinent bits of information about the nominees; last night, such factoids were presented in on-screen box that looked like it came from an especially sober <em>Pop-Up Video</em> episode, and which peddled out the kind of info most people either already knew or could easily look up online (Emily Blunt was in <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>? Ooh, <em>do</em> tell me more!). As a result, all of the actually intriguing bits of information wound up on Twitter: Did you know, for example, that Kira Roessler—one of the members of the <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> sound editing crew—was a former member of Black Flag? Or that once-scrappy studio A24—which launched in 2013—won three Oscars for three different movies last night (<em>Room</em>, <em>Amy</em>, <em>Ex Machina</em>), more than any other indie company? Or that Russell Crowe, for all his phone-throwingness, just likes to yuck it up with his pal Ryan Gosling, so long as it's a controlled environment with a rehearsed speech, and there's no one in his sightline? The things you learn!
