The fact that we're finally getting an all-female Ghostbusters is kind of crazy. But the fact that it's coming out in July and we heretofore hadn't seen any footage of the ghost-bustin' ladies -- Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, and Kristen Wiig -- is just insane. Well, now that wait is over. Behold! The first trailer for director Paul Feig's Ghostbusters is here.
