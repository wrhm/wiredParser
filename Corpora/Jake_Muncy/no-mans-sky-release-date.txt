No Man's Sky, the much-hyped space explorer with a nearly-infinite, randomly-generated universe, finally has its official release date: June 21 on PlayStation 4 and PC. With the collaboration of Sony, who have heavily supported Hello Games' work on the project, the game's PlayStation 4 version will also be getting a physical release, good box art and all.
If that's still not enough to satiate your space-based fandom, Hello Games is partnering with I Am 8-Bit for a line of merchandise and special editions called, fittingly, the No Man's Sky Collection. There's a $150 "Explorer's Edition" with a hand-painted ship replica, for the hardcore collectors. (The regular edition of the game is $60.)
For my money, though, the highlight of the collection so far is the double-LP of the No Man's Sky soundtrack by electronic post-rockers 65daysofstatic.
