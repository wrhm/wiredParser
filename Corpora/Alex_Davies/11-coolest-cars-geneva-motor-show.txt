For most people, Switzerland is known for chocolate, watches, and neutrality. For car enthusiasts, it is known for excess. That's because the annual Geneva International Motor Show is where automakers tend to show off their most outrageous cars.
It's always like that, but this year was something else entirely. Lamborghini showed off the $1.9 million Centenario supercar, a vehicle that is insanely over the top even for Lamborghini. Aston Martin revealed the stunning DB11, which may be the car to save the company. McLaren, Maserati, Porsche, Ferrari, and Bentley unveiled new cars, each promising mind-warping performance and prices to match. And then there was Bugatti. It stole the show with the $2.6 million Chiron, a car designed to supercede the Veyron as the most outrageous automobile ever built.
Nearly 100 cars and concepts made their world premier in Geneva this week. These are the most noteworthy, most exciting, and most amazing of the bunch.
